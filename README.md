# PHP API for integrating with the IntelliSMS service

https://www.intellisms.co.uk

This is based on their official PHP SDK, but with some modifications to add namespacing, remove deprecated functions,
and hopefully otherwise modernise.


## License

Propose this is released under this license:

[Apache License, Version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html)

However, the original code is provided without license, which would imply copyright and non
OSS by default. Of course, it is massively to the benefit of IntelliSMS to have a 
well-maintained and easily available PHP API available so I don't see too much 
opposition here.


## TODO

- add test coverage
- add inline documentation where useful
- pass comms out to (say) Guzzle library
- better support for PSRs
- approve license/distribution with IntelliSMS
