# PHP API for integrating with the IntelliSMS service

https://www.intellisms.co.uk

This is based on their official PHP SDK, but with some modifications to add namespacing, remove deprecated functions,
and hopefully otherwise modernise.

## TODO

- add test coverage
- add inline documentation where useful
- pass comms out to (say) Guzzle library
- better support for PSRs
